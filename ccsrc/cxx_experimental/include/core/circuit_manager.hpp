//! Class keeping track of the mapping between various Qubit/Cbit ID types
/*!
 * There are mainly three sets of qubit IDs that we need to keep track of:
 *   - External IDs: assigned to qubits by External
 *   - Tweedledum IDs: ID of the wire in the underlying tweedledum network
 *   - Physical IDs: ID of the wire on the physical hardware
 *
 * In addition to the above three, mapping qubit IDs introduces an additional set of IDs:
 *   - virtual IDs: normalised set of IDs within the mapped dag
 *
 * However the latter type is not really relevant in most cases so these are not stored within a CircuitManager
 * instance.
 *
 * This class is also responsible for managing the internal circuit representation. The current representation
 * uses a list of CircuitBlock in order to represent the full circuit. The last element of that list is called
 * the "uncommitted" block in the following and is the circuit block to which all new operations get added.
 *
 * Upon certain triggering events, a new block may be added to the list in which case the current uncommitted
 * block becomes "committed" and a new fresh cicuit block gets added to the list.
